## Projects
- Flutter App 1: Introducing QRShop, the ultimate shopping app for small business owners. With our platform, shop owners can easily manage their inventory, process transactions, and keep track of sales - all with just a smartphone!

QRShop works by scanning QR codes that are placed on each product in the shop. When a customer scans a product's QR code, it's automatically added to their cart with the correct price. This eliminates the need for a traditional barcode scanner and makes the checkout process faster and more efficient.

In addition to scanning QR codes, shop owners can also generate their own QR codes for their products. This makes it easy to keep track of inventory and update prices as needed.

When a customer is ready to check out, QRShop will automatically calculate the total amount due and add it to an Excel sheet. This sheet can then be used to keep track of sales and monitor inventory levels. And because QRShop is completely mobile, shop owners can easily manage their business from anywhere.

With QRShop, small business owners can streamline their operations, save time, and boost sales - all with a simple and easy-to-use app. So whether you're a new shop owner or an established business, QRShop is the perfect solution for managing your shop with ease.

- Flutter App 2: Welcome to our all-in-one travel app! With our platform, users can easily plan and book their dream vacations, all while earning rewards and exploring the great outdoors.

Our app offers a seamless user experience, allowing users to quickly and easily create an account, login, and start browsing our wide selection of hotels, safari tours, and rental cars. We also offer a wishlist system, so users can save their favorite destinations and come back to them later.

But that's just the beginning. We've also integrated QR codes throughout our platform, which users can scan to earn reward points. These QR codes are placed at specific destinations, cars, and hotels, so users can earn points simply by exploring the world around them.

We've also integrated a map system, so users can track rare wildlife and explore the great outdoors like never before. And with our weather API, users can always stay on top of the latest weather conditions and plan their activities accordingly.

But that's not all - we also offer a way for users to earn cash by listing their own hotels or cars on our platform. This not only helps users earn some extra money, but also adds to our growing selection of travel options.

So whether you're looking to book your dream vacation or simply explore the world around you, our travel app has everything you need to get started.
