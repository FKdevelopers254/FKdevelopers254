## Projects

## QRShop
- Flutter App 1: Introducing QRShop, the ultimate shopping app for small business owners. With our platform, shop owners can easily manage their inventory, process transactions, and keep track of sales - all with just a smartphone!

QRShop works by scanning QR codes that are placed on each product in the shop. When a customer scans a product's QR code, it's automatically added to their cart with the correct price. This eliminates the need for a traditional barcode scanner and makes the checkout process faster and more efficient.

In addition to scanning QR codes, shop owners can also generate their own QR codes for their products. This makes it easy to keep track of inventory and update prices as needed.

When a customer is ready to check out, QRShop will automatically calculate the total amount due and add it to an Excel sheet. This sheet can then be used to keep track of sales and monitor inventory levels. And because QRShop is completely mobile, shop owners can easily manage their business from anywhere.

With QRShop, small business owners can streamline their operations, save time, and boost sales - all with a simple and easy-to-use app. So whether you're a new shop owner or an established business, QRShop is the perfect solution for managing your shop with ease.
